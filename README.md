# Templates for simple "Hello World" apps built on DeSo Protocol API
Right now there are 2 simple apps in ReactJS and NextJS, NextJS app is same ReactJS app, but adapted for NextJS. So devs can clone them and experiment with DeSo Protocol https://github.com/deso-protocol

## Here is what those apps can do out of the box

✔ Authorize user with Derived Keys using DeSo Identity service

✔ Load user profile to get username and profile image  

✔ Switch between authorized users.  

✔ Create and Submit Post Transaction

To see apps in action you must have profile at DeSo. 
These template apps are deployed to Netlify and Vercel from this repository. Here are the links:

https://deso-template.netlify.app/	- ReactJS

https://deso-template.vercel.app/	- NextJS

Those apps are using DeSo Identity JavaScript library to create and sign transactions https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deso-core/identity
